Summary:

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm composed of Decision Trees. It inherits hyperparameters from both DecisionTreeClassifier (for tree growth) and BaggingClassifier (for ensemble control). 
The algorithm introduces extra randomness during tree growth by considering a random subset of features for each node split, promoting greater tree diversity, which balances bias and variance for 
improved model performance.

In the context of a COVID-19 case study using a Random Forest Classifier, the goal is to predict the 'state' of patients based on a dataset from South Korean COVID-19 cases. 
The study underscores the vital role of data science in addressing real-world situations like pandemics, emphasizing the application of machine learning techniques to gain 
insights and make predictions in health-related scenarios.
